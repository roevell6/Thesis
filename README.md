# Identifying Sleep-Conducive Audio Features in Music Using Spectral Analysis, and Deep Learning with Prescriptive Analysis for Enhanced Sleep Quality

This project processes audio files and generates spectrograms using various audio analysis techniques including STFT, MFCC, and CQT.

## Features
- Audio processing with STFT, MFCC, and CQT
- Parallel processing using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Generation of 224x224 spectrograms for 5-second segments
- Analysis of optimal audio characteristics

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment (recommended):
```python
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
